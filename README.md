# SharePlace Frontend

[SharePlace](https://shareplace.cartermoore.ca/) is a social media app for sharing places. View a list of users, and click a user to view the places they've shared. Each place is saved with an image and details about the place. SharePlace makes use of the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding) to convert the place's address to coordinates, and then allows you to view that location on Google Maps in-app. You can also create an account, upload a unique profile picture, and share your own places!

SharePlace was built on the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with the purpose of growing my knowledge of these technologies. While I've done a fair bit of React development prior, this was my first major fullstack app using MongoDB, Express, and Node, so it was a great learning experience, and I can now say I'm very comfortable with this tech stack. The project also taught me about several other important topics like JWT authorization, password hashing, and file upload/storage on a backend.

This project was created while following the [MERN Fullstack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/) Udemy course by [Academind](https://academind.com/). I coded along and put my own spin on the implementation for many parts of the app, but credit for the overall design, code structure, and idea goes to them.
